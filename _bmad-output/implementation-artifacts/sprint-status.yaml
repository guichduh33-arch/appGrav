# ==================
# Epic Status:
#   - backlog: Epic not yet started
#   - in-progress: Epic actively being worked on
#   - done: All stories in epic completed
#
# Epic Status Transitions:
#   - backlog → in-progress: Automatically when first story is created (via create-story)
#   - in-progress → done: Manually when all stories reach 'done' status
#
# Story Status:
#   - backlog: Story only exists in epic file
#   - ready-for-dev: Story file created in stories folder
#   - in-progress: Developer actively working on implementation
#   - review: Ready for code review (via Dev's code-review workflow)

#
# WORKFLOW NOTES:
# ===============
# - Epic transitions to 'in-progress' automatically when first story is created
# - Stories can be worked in parallel if team capacity allows
# - SM typically creates next story after previous one is 'done' to incorporate learnings
# - Dev moves story to 'review', then runs code-review (fresh context, different LLM recommended)
